# Regression Project: Estimating Home Value

### Goal:
To be able to predict the values of **single unit properties** that the tax district assesses using the property data from those with a transaction during the "hot months" (in terms of real estate demand) of **May-August, 2017**.

### Project Goals:
-Use machine learning regression algorithms to predict the tax value of single homes, using data from the Zillow database.
-Visualize the distribution of tax rates for each county using the fips data.
-Present findings to the Zillow Data Science Team.

### Deliverables:
1. A report in the form of a presentation, verbal supported by slides.
    The report/presentation slides should summarize your findings about the drivers of the single unit property values. This will come from the analysis you do during the exploration phase of the pipeline. In the report, you should have visualizations that support your main points.
    The presentation should be no longer than 5 minutes.
2. A github repository containing your work.
    This repository should contain one clearly labeled final Jupyter Notebook that walks through the pipeline, but, if you wish, you may split your work among 2 notebooks, one for exploration and one for modeling. In exploration, you should perform your analysis including the use of at least two statistical tests along with visualizations documenting hypotheses and takeaways. In modeling, you should establish a baseline that you attempt to beat with various algorithms and/or hyperparameters. Evaluate your model by computing the metrics and comparing.
    Make sure your notebook answers all the questions posed in the email from the Zillow data science team.
    The repository should also contain the .py files necessary to reproduce your work, and your work must be reproducible by someone with their own env.py file.
    As with every project you do, you should have an excellent README.md file documenting your project planning with instructions on how someone could clone and reproduce your project on their own machine. Include at least your goals for the project, a data dictionary, and key findings and takeaways. Your code should be well documented.
